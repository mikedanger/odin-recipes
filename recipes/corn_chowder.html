        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Just like Mom makes</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 slices of bacon, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, peeled and cut into 1/4 inch dice</li>
            <li>2 ribs of celery, cut into 1/4 inch dice</li>
            <li>1 large red pepper, seeded, cored, and cut into 1/4 inch dice</li>
            <li>2 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4 inch dice</li>
            <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dried thyme</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dried dill</li>
            <li>4 cups frozen corn kernels</li>
            <li>2 cups light cream or half-and-half</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>Ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cornstarch and 1 tbsp cold water (to thicken, optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large soup pot, fry the bacon until crisp in olive oil, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the onion, celery, and red pepper. Saute over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until
                vegetables soften, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add potatoes, broth, and herbs, and simmer about 15 minutes, adjusting heat if necessary
                so that liquid does not boil.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in corn, cream, salt, and pepper, and simmer over low heat until corn is cooked.</li>
            <li>If you want to thicken soup, stir in cornstarch mixture and cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Ladle into bowls and serve immediately. May garnish with chopped fresh parsley and a pat of butter if desired.</li>
        </ol>
