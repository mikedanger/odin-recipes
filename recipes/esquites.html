            <li>2 tablespoons (30 ml) mayonnaise</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over high heat until shimmering. Add corn kernels, season to taste
                with salt, toss once or twice, and cook without moving until charred on one side, about 2 minutes. 
                Toss corn, stir, and repeat until charred on second side, about 2 minutes longer. Continue tossing and charring
                until corn is well charred all over, about 10 minutes total. Transfer to a large bowl.
